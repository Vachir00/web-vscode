# Welcome !
This is a personal project to manage my developments. I'm updating it perodically based on my necessity, feel free to make any change you need for your projects.
## Functions

- Web editor: I'm using monaco, it is not like vscode, it is more like a notepad with esteroids, I used it when I need an editor, and I'm not allowed to use VSCode, weird case, but it occurs.
- cURL: I thought I would need it, but, for a rare reason, postman is less dangerous than VSCode for some companies, so once I am not able to use it, I'll create that function.
- Database: This is the newest feature, and it is intended to connect to a database and export a diagram that you could get as SVG to use it privately. **I did not test it on MySQL (yet)**

## How to use it
Easy, pretty easy, you could use my docker image (published on Docker Hub) vachir00/web-vscode:0.4 . Feel free to use it anywhere you need. If you want to use the source code, you will have to download it, install dependecies, install postgresql client, and try.

**Please remember it is from a developer for developers, and it was made using Gemini and GPT, so use them to install it!**

**The docker image works only for PostgreSQL17**

if you run

    docker run --network bridge -p 3000:3000 vachir00/web-vscode:0.4

it will work.

**if you want to have a docker-compose file, or a specific configuration, it is all for you! so do it!**

## Contact me
Well, if you wanna talk about weird things like software, linux, or this specific development, use GitHub. I won't respond quickly and as well I don't know how to use it, so be patient and kind.
Adios!
